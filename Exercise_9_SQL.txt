SALES DATABASE

Create an index that will enable a user to pull orders for ‘1990-10-03’ out of the Orders table quickly.

	CREATE INDEX ind_order_date ON orders(odate);
	SELECT * FROM orders WHERE odate = '1990-10-03';

 If the Orders table has already been created, how can you force the onum field to be unique (assume all current values are unique)? 


ans--

first off all we have to remove the null constraint and apply a NOT NULL constraint on the column. To do this execute the following query

	ALTER TABLE orders ALTER column onum int NOT NULL;

After that you can apply a primary key on that same column. To do this execute the following query

	ALTER TABLE orders ADD PRIMARY KEY (onum);

Create an index that would permit salesperson to retrieve his orders.

***     
Let us assume that each salesperson is to have only one customer of a given rating, and that this is currently the case. Create an index that enforces it.

    	ALTER TABLE customers ALTER column rating INT NOT NULL;

    	ALTER TABLE customers ADD PRIMARY KEY (rating);

***
Create an index to speed up searching order on a given date by given customer.
